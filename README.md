# ChordPro2SVG
Simple command line converter from ChordPro (lyrics + chords) to SVG (vectorial image).


## Synopsis

ChordPro2SVG allow to convert easily ChordPro files into SVG, in a similar way chordii converts from ChordPro to Postscript.
ChordPro2SVG doesn't care at all about editing, but simply aims to facilitate conversion of an archive of (editable) chord 
pro file into an images gallery to be viewed and shared easily.

## Motivation

Having lots of chordpro file in a single directory I was looking for a simple tool to convert all them into images files 
(one image for each chordpro file) so that I can put them, for example in a shared folder, and simply view them without 
installing any additional software when playing.
